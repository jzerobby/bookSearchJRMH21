# Homework 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a book search engine app that have a menu with the options Search for Books, Login/Signup, an input field to search for books and a submit button.

Entering a search term in the input field and clicking the submit button not logged in, you're going to see several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books website. On the Login/Signup menu option a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up. 

If the toggle is set to Signup, you're presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, a password, and a signup button. But if the toggle is set to Login you will have two inputs for an email address and a password and login button only. 

With a valid email address, creating a password and clicking the signup button, your user account will be created and you can log in to the site. Inputing your email address and password and clicking on the login button, the modal will close and you're going to be logged in to the site. Once you logged in, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see your saved books, and Logout. 

By putting a search term in the input field and clicking the submit button, you will have several search results. Each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to your account. 

Saving by clicking on the Save button on a book, that book’s information will be save to your account. In your saved books you're gonna see all of the books you have saved in your account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account. The Remove button on a book deletes it from your saved books list. The Logout button logs you out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.  

Most modern websites are driven by data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

With a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, I refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
